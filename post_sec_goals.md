### Johnson Wales University

Intended Major: Computer Security
* * *
I chose JWU because they provide a very good Computer Security program. When I visited the college, the environment was very welcoming and I could see myself going to school there. Lastly, thier Computer Science and Computer Security programs are very closely related, allowing for lots of cross study and learning.
